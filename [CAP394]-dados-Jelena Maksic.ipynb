    "Various paleoclimate studies confirmed that Last Millennium (850 C.E -1850 C.E) is a period with important events and significant climate fluctuations such as the Medieval Climate Anomaly and the Little Ice Age. Emerging scientific literature continues to report more evidence for the occurrence of both the Medieval Warm Period and Little Ice Age in South America.  \n",
    "Therefore, it is crucial to examine climatic variability beyond the era of instrumental records through paleoclimate studies using proxies and modeling. My task is to reconstructing climate variability and vegetational changes during the past millennium using speleothem and tree-ring records from the South American monsoon region. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, studies that only use paleoclimate proxies may provide scarce, fragmented and local scale information, which limit the interpretation of past vegetational changes. "
